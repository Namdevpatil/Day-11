Array: 

1. stores similar type of values/objects in a variable
2. array works based on index concepts.

problems:

1. array size is fixed, when create an array when need to provide size of an array.
2. only stores similar type of values/objects, but not stores dissimilar type of values/objects
3. do not have API support.


To overcome above problems we use "java collection API".

Java Collections:

all java collections classes and interfaces are part of "java.util" package.

1. java collections size is not fixed, it will grows/shrink based on the manipulation of values/objects.
2. stores similar and dissimilar type of values/objects
3. We have proper API support.

** Java has two types of collections
	- value-based collections
		- for example, List, Set, Queue, Stack...etc
		
		Task: LinkedList, Vector and Stack
		
		List collection features:
		
		1. list collections stores duplicate values and null values
		
	- key-value based collections
		- for example, Map
